## What is ShieldWare?
ShieldWare is a web application that uses machine learning and advanced APIs to, given a user, track and display data on drugs, alcohol, or weapons-related social media posts. Its applications range from the school to the workplace, and it represents the herald of a new revolution in harnessing technology to create security.

## How does ShieldWare work?
ShieldWare consists of a Flask web application that harnesses the power of Sight Engine machine-learning APIs to graphically represent a given user's dangerous content posting history online. This content is shown in easy-to-understand line charts, and social media usernames can be searched up and analyzed; if dangerous content is detected, school or workplace administrators can take appropriate action to help the poster and/or dissuade them from potential future transgressions.

## How was ShieldWare built?
We built ShieldWare using Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the SightEngine social media analytics engine. The Python Flask server powers the app, and ChartJS is used for data rendering.

## What's next for ShieldWare?
ShieldWare is only a step away from widespread deployment. A tool as powerful as this, with this much lifesaving potential, must be put to use as soon as possible.
